While writing this blog I am in China. I have an immediate need for VPN, since so much SW and websites are dependent on the websites, which are barred in China.
I can install VPN clients on IPhone from AppStore, but I can't install VPN client on PC, since I can't reach the sites from China. So here is a fix.

## Download VPN client on IPhone - and Copy it to PC

If you can't download a VPN client to PC (due to restrictions in the country), then you can fetch the setup-file via IPhone:

* From AppStore install a **VPN client** - e.g. Le VPN, Astrill, IPVanish
* Subscribe, start VPN, login and activate VPN
    * Note: You will need to supply an email as userid - but also to receive VPN login details in.  
    So you'll need an email provider that can be accessed from you country - so case of China you can use [Outlook.com](https://outlook.live.com/owa/)
* From AppStore install **Firefox**
* From Firefox browse to the [VPN Download page](https://www.le-vpn.com/vpn-windows/)
* Upload to **cloud drive** e.g. ICloud, Onedrive, pCloud - you can do that with the app for the specific iCloud or with IPhone **Files** app
    * Download from Windows
* Or connect IPhone to PC with usb
    * Use iTunes on PC to transfer file

## Choose VPN

I have not tested much of VPNs, so it is limited knowledge I can come with. 

* [Astrill VPN](https://www.astrill.com/)
    * Pros:
        * Stays connected on the VPN even though you loose wifi or snoose your IPhone
    * Cons:
        * Yearly charge - I need monthly - or less
        * Low score on Trustpilot
    * Info:
        * I have not tested IPVanish from PC
* [Le VPN](https://www.le-vpn.com/)
    * Pros:
        * One week trial account - with no payment
        * Monthly charge - currently $10
        * Subscription is not default. By default you only pay for one period.
        * Can pay with Bitcoin (You don't have to supply your id through payment card)
    * Cons:
        * Disconnects the VPN when you loose wifi or snoose your IPhone
        * On PC I have trouble finding VPN servers, that lets me connect (from China). It does not seem to be a problem from IPhone. I wonder what it is on the PC, that gives those differnces?
        * Low score on Trustpilot
* [IPVanish VPN](https://www.ipvanish.com)
    * Pros:
        * Top score on Trustpilot
        * Monthly charge
    * Cons:
        * Subscription is default and mandatory. You will keep paying untill your card expires or you unsubscibe
    * Info:
        * I have not tested IPVanish

I have not not been choosing VPN for speed, privacy or security reasons, so there you have to do your own research.
