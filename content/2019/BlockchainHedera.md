* Fair - knowing which transaction came first
* Fast
* Secure
* Stable

* Hashgraph
    * Events instead of blocks
    * Node can gossib events to other nodes
    * Single --
    * Shards by time
    * ABFT - ASync BFT
    * Virtual voting - calculate from metadata, so we can predict what the vote would be.
        * Not a leader based system, so you can't take down the leader
    * No mining
        * Run nodes without mining - by governing council - will be 39 companies.
    * Distributed ProofOfStake 2/3 has to agree - proxystaking
        * of these events are ordered and middle time desides time in the order
        * earn from lending?
* Funding $124M -> hbar - 50B - can't buy, but earn by testing
* Swirls owns the patent of hashgraph
* coins will be bought back - for currency stablity?
* Files can be stored in the network - and deleted
* Multi signature support
* GDPR - right to be forgotten - data will expire in configured time
* Dapps in Solidity
    * Shardid - RoumId - AccountId
* Assert a claim to an account

* 2018
    * Mainnet live
    * Minted 50M hbars
    * 8-9 Hackathons
    * Wallet app
    * Testnet program
* Next
    * Phase 2 of testing - this year - but even wait list is full - but there will be 90k accounts - announces on telegram.

* How can you avoid double spending, when not all nodes are uptodate?
* Who are clostest competitor no-of-transactions wise? How are you better?
    * other chains use side-chains - they have security issues
* Only private networks?
* How many nodes in public network? 
* Proven tech? Can Scale?
* Many nodes will lead to lost events?

The End
