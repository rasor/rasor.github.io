* Q&A:
    * Should you use it for private stuff?
        * No - there is not auto-logoff, so both on desktop and mobile your apps vulnarable.
        * No - missing 2FA for web/desktop - missing fingerprint login on mobile.
    * Should I use the Stellar wallet to be able to send money to other keybasers?
        * Only if that wallet is for pocket money - and does not transact to your larger accounts. 
    * Can you use it in China?
        * No - you have to go through VPN
* Tips:
    * You can encrypt public github repos
    * You should only put proves on accounts you have 2fA control over e.g. Twitter. Thus nobody can change the proof you put there.
