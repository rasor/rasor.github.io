# VPN or Tor?

I wonder if Tor can be used for browsing sites that are normally barred within China?
Or can I get a the VPN in my Wifi router working as a gateway - It is using OpenVPN.

## OpenVPN

Cons: 

* My Wifi VPN is not exactly easy to configure. 

Pros:

* Does not give the cons from Tor.

### Installing OpenVPN

.....

## Tor

Questions:

* Can you browse normal websites at all from Tor? Yes - this is called the Surface web.
* Does China block the Tor Relays? I guess they block as many as they know of, which probably means all.

Cons: 

* Even though the aim of using Tor would just be to reach normal websites like Google, then it will probably attract unwanted attention from e.g. agencies.
* I assume you can't download Tor browser, If you are inside China.

### DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo is good for removing trackers.

* Chrome plugin: [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg)
* [Mobile App](https://duckduckgo.com/app?natb=v166-2__&cp=atbaoct)

But DuckDuckGo also provides an Onion service, which is Google Search for the Tor browser.
