Components:
Package to or fetch from
https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/

Use SAM templates for build
https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/

Use AWS CDK template (JS) to generate 400 lines of cloud formation template YAML  
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html
npm install aws-cdk

CodeDeploy for ECS blue-greem deployment

\app\ # serverless app
    \template.yaml # IaC, Events, Methods
\pipeline\ # build
    \buildspec.yaml # using SAM

## 11:10 - 12:00 | Building Infastructure as code using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

CDK docs:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html
https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk # is OSS - how about build a tool for ARM?

IaC Options:
* Components # high level, AWS CDK, Pulumi
* DSLs #Troposphere (py), SparkleFormation (rb), GoFormation (Go)
* Declaratative # cloud formation, terraform
* Scripted # low level, AWS SDK and CLI

Langs:
* TS, JS
* Java, C#, Py

CDK:
* Constructs are modules in TS created using construct library [CDK API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html)
* You can share your Construct as npm modules

```bash
npm install aws-cdk
cdk init sample-app --language typescript
npm run watch # recompile while working
cdk synth # create cloud formation template
cdk bootstrap # creates a S3 bucket for data while deploy. Creates a cloudformation changeset
cdk deploy # takes longer... 
cloudformation # check resources in portal
# Modify cdk-talk-stack.ts
cdk diff # diff of deployed and local code
cdk deploy

npm install @aws-cdk/aws-lambda # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-readme.html
# Create lambda code to be deployed - e.g. some js
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-apigateway-readme.html
# Add GW to code
cdk diff # diff of deployed and local code
cdk deploy
```

Content:
\lib\
    cdk-talk-stack.ts # meat - the IaC - create the constructs

## 13:00 - 13:50 | Simplify your web and mobile apps with serverless backend in the cloud

Is serverless:
* S3
* DynamoDB 

### AWS Amplify
https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/
amplify-react-workshop
https://github.com/sebsto/amplify-react-workshop

```bash
# within e.g. react app...
amplify init
amplify push # data in cloud needed for amplify
amplify add auth # generates code for auth using AWS Cognito, IAM, API key or ?, which can either use hosted login page or in-app login.
amplify add api # graphQL API or REST incl obj mapper to DynamoDB
amplify add hosting # hosts a static web in S3 CDN 
amplify push
amplify publish (prod)
```

Libs for all frontend tools

app.js
```javascript
import Amplify;
import {withAuthentication};
```

TRamformers - @model

\amplify\ # generated folder by push??

Using AWS AppSync - creates GraphQL serverless API
https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/

If you add @searchable then it it not serverless - but using also ElasticSearch charged by the hour.

Git workflow
```bash
amplify checkout ENV # ENV is git branch?
amplify add ENV
```

## 14:00 - 14:50 | 0 to 100kmh with GraphQL. Rapid API Prototyping using serverless backend in the cloud

REST
* Too much - overfetching: All objs in a graph
* Too little: Chatty - fetch each entity in a graph
GraphQL
* Schemas
* TypeSafe
* Efficient - fetch from (resolve to) many DBs
    * A resolver can be added on each field
* Easy test
* Realtime - subscribe

Use AWS AppSync - creates GraphQL serverless API
https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/
There are also OSS alternatives

You can put auth in serverless auth layer
or you can nest queries # if owner is...

## 15:10 - 16:00 | Cloud backend for real-time applications

https://github.com/thebeebs/simple-websockets-chat-app

Real-time evolution:
* Long Polling # server answers when event happens
* Forever frames
* Server sent events (SSE) # not duplex - two channels for both ways
* Web sockets (WS) # duplex - just data
    * C# SignalR
    * Js Socket.io

Before:
Deployed to: 
* Elastic Beanstalk
    * App: http://voting.thebeebs.org/
    * Using sticky sessions
With backplane:
* ElasticCache for Redis

After:
AWS API GW and WebSockets

Also:
AWS AppSync GraphQL to DynamoDB # You can subscribe to changes in DB

# Tools

Spotlight # for demo
