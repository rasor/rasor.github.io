    * DApps should not implement the wallets, but just interact with them:
        * Qoutes:
            * _[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), has created browser extensions to handle key management and facilitate interaction with dapps._
            * _[Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) & [Brave](https://brave.com/) have gone the route of creating an entirely new browser._
            * _We have websites and phones and computers and Xbox’s and our doorbells and our cars and even the lock on our front door. And all of these things will probably want to interact with the blockchain at some point and facilitate transactions._
