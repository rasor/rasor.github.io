If you have had the thought of using Google Drive as the place where you store your links - just as when you have them on your desktop, then you will learn that you can't navigate to the URL by double-clicking on them.

There are several plugins for Chrome.
The first one I found useful was [LinkTo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkto/goapcakmlfahhdehdkbejkcpoddbdikm){:target="_blank"}

With LinkTo installed you can both right-click or double-click in Google Drive on a link to navigate to that URL.

It also has more features, but the double-click feature is the only one I need so far.

The End
