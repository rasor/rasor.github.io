Hi there.

I have moved. Previously I was living on <https://rasor.wordpress.com/>.

### Reason for move
* I wanted Mardown markup
* I wanted better syntax highligting for code

### Pros
* I got an easier way of editing categories and tags
    * Categories: In your content folder you create a subfolder for each tag and you store your .md file in there.
    * Tags: You just write them inside your .md
* Updates to a blog has its own field e.g. Modified: 2017-09-24 09:00

### Cons
* No central editing of tags - well that is a releaf, because it was cumbersome to add one, when you in the middle of editing in Wordpress
* No img size editing tool
* Setting up to be published in GitHupPages was not described well, so I had to create a [procedure]({filename}/study/2017-09-23B-PelicanBlogOnGithubPages.md) myself. I am quite pleased with the workflow now. Not too much hazzle, when you are working with code and a terminal anyway.
