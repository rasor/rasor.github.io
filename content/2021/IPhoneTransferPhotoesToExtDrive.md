## Backup IPhone photos to C: on Windows

* Start ITunes
    * Connect IPhone to PC with cable
    * In IPhone: Allow connect on phone and login
* Open Explorer on `This PC\Apple iPhone` 
    * Await 2 minutes for `Internal Storage` to display in `This PC\Apple iPhone`
    * Copy `DCIM` folder to somewhere on `c:`
* When connection breaks windows will play a tune and popup a message telling about broken connection
    * Unplug device cable
        * This will close explorer window with the IPhone drive
    * Log into Iphone
        * This will allow windows to re-read IPhone drive, when re-connected
    * Plug in cable again
        * This will open explorer window with the IPhone drive
        * Await 2 minutes for `Internal Storage` to display in `This PC\Apple iPhone` in explorer
        * Drag'n'drop sub folder of `DCIM` folder to the place on `c:` where you dropped `DCIM`
            * Wait for the dialog to finish `calculating time`
            * When told that subfolder exists choose `SKIP` (overwrite files) and `do this for other items`
