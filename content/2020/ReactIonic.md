# CRA with Ionic

Why is this cool?  
* Ionic is a great mobile-first component lib
* Ionic has great PWA features
* Ionic can be build for native deployments

# CRA with Stencil WebComponents

Why is this cool?  
* You can within CRA use TypeScript to discover properties (attributes)
* You can set typed objects to properties

Why is it not so cool? (compared to using Stencil (or Angular) app as a webcomponent host)
* In Stencil a typed object on an attribute will both be settable and gettable from the host directly in the custom element
* Debugging webcomponents is not a good experience compared to debugging React components

The end
