Currently I can't find Linux distros preconfigured for Tablet PCs, so You'll have to do som configuration yourself.

## What's missing out of the box?

I ran Kubuntu from a usb-stick.
* Working:
    * Touch screen
* Not working:
    * Screen Auto-Rotation. When screen is switched x360 and held in portrait the screen should auto-rotate.
    * Tablet-Mode. When screen is switched x360, keyboard and touchpad should turn off and soft keyboard should appear, when being in an editor.
    * Fingerprint scanner - apparently no linux driver currently exists for that particular scanner 
* Probably not working:
    * Stylus Auto-Rotation

## HowTo enable?
