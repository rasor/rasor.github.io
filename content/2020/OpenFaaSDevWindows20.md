I want to install **OpenFaaS** again.  
This time running on **Kubernetes (k8s)**, **Docker Desktop**, **Windows Home 10** with **Virtual Machine Platform** on **WSL2**.  
Running Docker Desktop with [WSL2 backend has many improvements](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) over alternatives.  
Last time I installed Docker (in this [blog](https://rasor.github.io/openfaas-on-windows-devbox.html)), I was running on **Docker Swarm**, **Docker CE**, **Windows Pro 10** and **Hyper-V**.

[@alexellisuk](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk) has build yet a great tool. One being [Arkade](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade).  
It is great for installing lots of K8s goodies both locally and in cloud. I also includes OpenFaaS.

## Arkade
Your one-stop CLI for Kubernetes

### Install on devbox on Windows

#### Prerequisites.

You need Docker. Start by typing    
```bash
docker -v
```  
to see if you already have it installed.  
If not then follow [this tutorial to get it](Docker4Win20.md).  
In that blog I ended up with **Docker Desktop** on **Windows Home 10** with **Virtual Machine Platform** incl. **WSL2**.

### K8S

Now that we have Docker, then it is time to play with Arkade to install k8s and other stuff

But there are other options than **Arkade** to install k8s?
* On localhost
    * Using **Kind**
        * [Installing Kubernetes with Kind](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/kind/)
    * Using **Minikube**
        * [Install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
        * [Installing Kubernetes with Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/)
    * Enable k8s in **Docker Desktop**
* In cloud
    * All cloud providers have their own k8s services

So why use Arkade to install k8s?
* If you only need a single node cluster then option 3 - using **Docker Desktop** automates the work you manually can do with **Minikube**.  
* If you need a multi node cluster then option 0 - using **Arkade** automates the work you manually can do with **Kind**.  
* **Arkade** also automates the work you need to do with other k8s related tools.

#### Already have a k8s cluster?

k8s install is only the top of the iceberg of Arkade.  
If you already have a k8s cluster then Arkade kicks in by installing lost of 
* k8s apps from e.g. [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/) (with `ark install`) and/or
* CLIs for k8s or apps (with `ark get`) 

Arkade then __unifies fetching packages__ across platforms. Before:
* `apt-get` on some Linux versions
* `yum` on some other Linux versions
* `choco` on Windows
* `brew` on Mac

Under the hood Arkade __simplifies commands__ by using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) as the k8s package manager and `kubectl` commands.

#### Install Arkade

```

Both attemps failed - instead get manual recipe: [get.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexellis/arkade/master/get.sh)  
1. Open your web browser and go to https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/releases
2. Download the latest release for windows to C:\Users\yourusername\.arkade\bin\arkade`
3. Add path to environment  
```cmd
setx PATH "%path%;C:\Users\yourusername\.arkade\bin"
```
4. Create a symbolic link
```bash
export ALIAS_NAME="ark"
export REPO=arkade
export BINLOCATION="/c/users/yourusername/.arkade/bin"
chmod +x "$BINLOCATION/$REPO"
ln -sf "$BINLOCATION/$REPO" "$BINLOCATION/$ALIAS_NAME"
```
