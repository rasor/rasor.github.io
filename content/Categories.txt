Here I add the categories, that I use in the blogs.
Reason for not using ~/content/categoryname1/someblog.md is that I want the blogs stored by year.
I think that gives me a better way to be able to find a blog again and still not having all blogs just in one folder.
So by using this file I have means to keep track of all categories.
The categories are much fewer than in my last blog.
