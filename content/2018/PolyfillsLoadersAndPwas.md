# Polyfills

Using new cool javascript features and frameworks requires polyfills for the browsers, that don't support them.

And how do you then do it?

There can be several strategies.  
I am currently looking at this

1. Add Global Fallback for non-supported browsers
2. Use polyfills.io to determine which polyfills to return to the browser based on the browser agent - with a swich
3. Load a framework including what it includes of polyfills
4. Load my own code

## Ad 1.

IE is often target for fallbacks. You can use [IE conditional comments].(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/HTML_and_CSS#IE_conditional_comments)

## Ad 2. 

With the IE condition above you can load special polyfils using polyfill.io and [overriding the user-agent](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/examples#override-ua).  
Otherwise then just use [basic case](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/examples#basic).  

## Ad 3

When using polyfill.io [her are two ways of loading polyfills.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/examples#feature-detection) before you code

* Using a callback or perhasp an [onload event on script tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16230886/trying-to-fire-the-onload-event-on-script-tag) or a [Script Loader](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-loader)
* Pre-specify needed features in  [client-side feature detection](https://output.jsbin.com/sufiboz/)
* But recommended is to use [server-side feature detection](https://webplatform.github.io/docs/concepts/Detecting_device_and_browser/)
 using the user-agent to serve different pages and polifills according to browser

# Frameworks and tools

## Polyfills and PWA

PWA's delivers [progressive enhancement](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/progressive-web-apps/) meaning they provide some sort of fallback for unsupported features. But if your PWA don't support a feature, you might still want to enable the feature using extra polyfills.
