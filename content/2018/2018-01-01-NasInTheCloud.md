For the last many years I've been warming up to buy a NAS solution for my home with mirroved disks and at least 1 TB.

I have I-drives at several providers, since the free veersion does nog give much space compared to what you often wants to backup.
One of those providers being pCloud.
They have for long been sending me notices about my free space (10 GB) running out.
This time I acted on one such notice and was sent to [Cloud Storage Pricing & Cost, Cloud Storage Plans](https://www.pcloud.com/cloud-storage-pricing-plans.html)

Now it was possible to get 2 TB storage for a onetime payment for a lifetime period for a price probably lower than I could get a mirrowed disk solution at home for.  
Price: EUR 250,-

### Pros

* Storage is striped or mirrowed on 5 disks - not only 2
* If one disk dies, I won't have to replace it - that's managed and included
* 30 days backup - if wannacry hits my PC and encrypts my drives, I can just restore that cloud drive with a click
* I can share folders with other people without affecting adding cost for them
* Apps for IOS and Android
* Two phase authentication using my facebook account

### Cons

* Bandwitdh much lower than local wifi or USB
* The could drive takes up some space for caching on your local drive, which it uses for sync, so you won't have 2 TB locally, only whatever you assing for your cache
* Seems to not the best integration with uppload photos from IOS, but neither would a local NAS be, probably

So finally I won't have to worry about loosing photos and other content.

The End
