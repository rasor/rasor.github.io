Development using Drag'n'drop ([Low-code development platforms - LCDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platforms))
 is also taking a share in development pipelines with test/prod environments and version control.

Some of the areas are

1. Automated Business UI Process development - [RPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation). Automated frontend using existing UI as data transfer channel are created in this category. 
2. Application development - [hpaPaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service). Apps, Webapps (frontends) and APIs (backends) are created in this category.
3. Application APIs - [mBaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_backend_as_a_service). This is backend exposing APIs to receive/produce data.
4. Application integration - [ESB / iPaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus). This is middleware/backend using and exposing APIs to transfer data (B2B).

## 1. RPA

Top RPA players are

## 2. hpaPaaS

In 2017 Microsoft Access RAD tools are called **High Productivity Application Platform as a Service** (hpaPaaS)

In the top quadrant there are only 3 players

* [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/)
* [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/) - C# + Java
* [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/) - C#
* [Microsoft Azure Power Apps + (Flow + Logic Apps)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFwiZYxQboQ)

Download the [Gartner Quadrant](https://www.mendix.com/resources/gartner-high-productivity-apaas/) to learn more.  
*According to Gartner, by 2020, at least 50 percent of all new business applications will be created with high-productivity toolsets*

## 3. API

To create IOT or mobile backends there are API tools

## 4. ESB / iPaaS / MaaS

To tie applications together there are integration tools also called ESBs
