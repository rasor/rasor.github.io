For a development project I needed Docker for Windows.  
In this blog I'll install Docker. Playing with it I'll do in another post.  

## Install

You download [Docker CE for Windows here](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).  

Docker wants to know if you want to use Windows or Linux containers - Since I'll deploy to Linux in production, I also choose Linux here. Linux will ususally be the cheepest choise in cloud.  
The version I installed was 18.03.1-ce-win65.  
Note: The installer will log you out to be able to finish.  

## 1st test drive

When starting Docker from the Desktop Icon I was met with:  
![Docker will disable VirtualBox](img/2018/2018-05-06-Docker4Win1.PNG)  

Docker will disable VirtualBox. Oh-oh - I am using VirtualBox for OpenShift - so I don't want that option.  
When I press cancel I get:

Damned - I don't have other option than to let the bastard disable VirtualBox - I wonder if this disabling is only for Docker4Windows... I'll bite the grasss and do as I'm told.  

## 2nd test drive

Ok, so 2nd time I started Docker I chose OK to enable Hyper-V and Container services. That also required a restart.  

When it was done enabling and restarting it still needed some time to boot the Docker VM. Meanwhile I could take a look and see what the installation had done.  
It had enabled the Windows features Containers and Hyper-V as it told me

It had enabled two Hyper-V Virtual Ethernet Adapters, but my VirtualBox networks remained. I wonder if I easily can switch to VirtualBox then?

When it was done starting the Docker VM I could see it running in Hyper-V manager

It was called MobyLinuxVM

Docker4Win wanted me to login to Docker Cloud. Docker Cloud uses Docker Hub as image registry, so even though I won't use Docker Cloud at this time, I'll need to be logged in to Docker.

Docker4Win GUI disappears, when you log in - but then you go to TaskBar-Notification area to find Docker4Win. Choose Settings

I unchecked `Start Docker when you log in`. Then I hope I can be using VirtualBox, too. I am unsure if I have to disable Hyper-V and/or Container services before that is possible. I'll come back with an update later.
