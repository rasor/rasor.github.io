For a development project I needed Docker for Windows (D4W).  
In this blog I'll install Docker. Playing with it I'll do in another post.  

## Prerequisite

* Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - This will install `Git Bash`
* Optional Install [cUrl CLI on Windows](https://rasor.github.io/curl-cli-on-windows.html) - This will ensure that you can call a remote end over SSL

## Install

You download [Docker CE for Windows here](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).  

Docker wants to know if you want to use Windows or Linux containers - Since I'll deploy to Linux in production, I also choose Linux here. Linux will ususally be the cheepest choise in cloud.  
The version I installed was 18.03.1-ce-win65.  
Note: The installer will log you out to be able to finish.  

## 1st test drive

When starting Docker from the Desktop Icon I was met with:  
![Docker will disable VirtualBox](img/2018/2018-05-06-Docker4Win1.PNG)  

Docker will disable VirtualBox. Oh-oh - I am using VirtualBox for OpenShift - so I don't want that option.  
When I press cancel I get:

Damned - I don't have other option than to let the bastard disable VirtualBox - I wonder if this disabling is only for Docker4Windows... I'll bite the grasss and do as I'm told.  

## 2nd test drive

Ok, so 2nd time I started Docker I chose OK to enable Hyper-V and Container services. That also required a restart.  

When it was done enabling and restarting it still needed some time to boot the Docker VM. Meanwhile I could take a look and see what the installation had done.  
It had enabled the Windows features Containers and Hyper-V as it told me

It had enabled two Hyper-V Virtual Ethernet Adapters, but my VirtualBox networks remained. I wonder if I easily can switch to VirtualBox then?

When it was done starting the Docker VM I could see it running in Hyper-V manager

It was called MobyLinuxVM

Docker4Win wanted me to login to Docker Cloud. Docker Cloud uses Docker Hub as image registry, so even though I won't use Docker Cloud at this time, I'll need to be logged in to Docker.

Docker4Win GUI disappears, when you log in - but then you go to TaskBar-Notification area to find Docker4Win. Choose Settings

I unchecked `Start Docker when you log in`. Then I hope I can be using VirtualBox, too. I am unsure if I have to disable Hyper-V and/or Container services before that is possible. I'll come back with an update later. 

After boot Docker VM will not be running, but you'll have docker client somewhere on the PC:

```bash
docker -v
# Docker version 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40
```

But while the VM is not running you'll get an error, when calling the VM:

```bash
docker images
# error during connect: Get http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.37/images/json: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified. In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run elevated to connect. This error may also indicate that the docker daemon is not running.
```

## Workflow

After boot you'll be able to do like this:  

* Start D4W from the Desktop icon - and wait for the Docker animation in the taskbar-notofication-area to end - then Docker VM has started
* Call D4W:

```bash
docker images
# REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
```

* Do some more work from bash e.g. read [Docker Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/docker_succinctly)

## AddOns

The Docker taksbar menu gives you an option called Kitematic. When you select the menu you'll [start downloading Kitematic](https://download.docker.com/kitematic/Kitematic-Windows.zip).  
Kitematic is a GUI on top of your Docker CLI.  
Here I even have the option to switch back to VirtualBox. I'll do that later.

I wonder if that switch will work - changing shell from powershell to bash did not work - Kitematic is in time og writing only in Alpha.
