You might continue a while working with TFS before you jump to GIT.  
At least we do that at my work. For frontend projects like Ionic, Angular, Vue, etc using a CLI for generation code templates it makes most sense to to stay in VSCode (opposed to Visual Studio).  
So howto use TFS from VSCode?

* Make sure you are already connected to TFS from normal Visual Studio
* From the normal Visual Studio you need to change your workspace from `server` to `local`
    * Goto Source Control Explorer and edit workspaces
    * Change Location from `server` to `local`
    * Map the root of your npm project (in level with package.json) to where you want it (or where it already is) in TFS

* Install into VSCode [Visual Studio Team Services](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsts.team) plugin
* In the root of your npm project (in level with package.json) create a [.tfignore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/jj155786(v=vs.120)#tfignore-file-example) file.  
Here is a sample:

```bash
# .tfignore
# When using VSCode plugin Visual Studio Team Services
# https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsts.team
# .. then you need this .tfignore file

# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/jj155786(v=vs.120)#tfignore-file-example

# Ignore all files in the sub-folders
\node_modules
\.sourcemaps
\www
\platforms
```

* In your [VSCode user settings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48056972/how-to-connect-tfs-in-visual-studio-code/48070466#48070466) (File - Preferences - Settings) add:

```json
{
    "tfvc.location": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\TeamFoundation\\Team Explorer\\tf.exe",
    "tfvc.restrictWorkspace": true
}
```
* In VSCode you can now login to TFS with command (Ctrl-Shift-P) team signin, where youÂ´ll enter your corporate username and password
* So now you can checkin (incl see diffs, undo and exclude) to TFS from the Source Control tab
