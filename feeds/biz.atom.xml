&lt;p&gt;There are several plugins for Chrome.
The first one I found useful was &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkto/goapcakmlfahhdehdkbejkcpoddbdikm" target="_blank"&gt;LinkTo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With LinkTo installed you can both right-click or double-click in Google Drive on a link to navigate to that URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has more features, but the double-click feature is the only one I need so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ntxcode" target="_blank"&gt;ntxDev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
